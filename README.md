# Visibility-Graphs

This program outputs the visibility tree of a point on a 2D plane given obstacles in the form of disjoint line segments. 
Controls: 
First you must right click to position the observer at the mouse's current coordinates
Then you must left click to add points at desired locations, the most recent pair of unconnected points 
will be automatically connected to form a linesegment
After Adding all desired obstacles, you must right click to see the visibility tree of the observor
